Our goal is to encourage diverse groups to develop open source packages and to contribute to the larger R community. We plan to bring together attendees from industry, academia, government, nonprofits, and more. We'll spend two days collaborating with each other, building R packages and learning from each other.\n\n Not sure how this works? No worries, that probably means you should attend this event! Check out [writeups](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/10/31/ozunconf2017/) [of](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/11/17/unconf-sixtips/) [previous](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/06/05/unconf18/) [unconferences](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2018/05/reflections-on-the-ropensci-unconference.html) for details on how this generally works, and take a look at [past](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf18/issues) [Github](https://github.com/ropensci/ozunconf18/issues/) [issues](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf17) to get a sense of the projects people work on. Projects might include creating new packages from scratch, writing new vignettes, or closing issues on existing packages. We plan to have something for everyone to contribute, even if you consider yourself a beginner! \n\n Because we want our attendees to have a safe, enjoyable, and friendly experience at the unconf, we have a [code of conduct](/coc) that we encourage you to read.  \n\n Additionally, you can find the Github repo for this year's #chirunconf [here](https://github.com/chirunconf/chirunconf19)."
